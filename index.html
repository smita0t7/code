Bangtan Sonyeondan is the full form of BTS. Bangtan Sonyeondan is a combination of South Korean words mean resistance and hindrance to the principles that are a significant part of society. People are expected to accept these principles as something ordained by God. The music band encourages young adults to enquire about the truth, interpret the facts and figures and then decide if he wants to accept the principle or not.

        All the music videos released by the South Korean boy band revolve around present-day social issues prevailing in a society, for example, increasing levels of anxiety, stress and depression, lack of confidence, self-belief and self-esteem, unacceptance of a particular group in society, and the list goes on. The South Korean boy band is led by 7 young boys who are either in their teenage or in their early 20s.
